**ðŸ’¸ It's recommenced to use Spot instances as they are 30% to 90% cheaper !** As Spot instances interrupton is generally low, you probably won't get interruped during your session. However, make sure to save often nonetheless ðŸ˜‰

Example: using a n1-standard-4 (15 GB RAM, 4 CPUs, NVIDIA T4) Spot instance with 100 GB disk for 10 hours / month would cost approximatively 11.54$ / month.
