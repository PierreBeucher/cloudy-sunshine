**ðŸ’¸ It's recommenced to use Spot instances as they are 30% to 90% cheaper !** As Spot instances interrupton is generally low, you probably won't get interruped during your session. However, make sure to save often nonetheless ðŸ˜‰

Example: using an NV6ads A10 v5 (35 GB RAM, 6 CPUs, 1/6 NVIDIA A10) Spot instance with 100 GB disk for 10 hours / month would cost approximatively 9.24$ / month.
